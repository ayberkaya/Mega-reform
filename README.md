This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't resolve 'tailwindcss' in '/Users/kaya/Coding'"** — The bundler is using `/Users/kaya/Coding` as resolve context instead of the project folder. Not caused by MCP (MCP only affects Cursor’s file access). Try in order:

The default `dev` script uses webpack so Tailwind resolves correctly. Use `bun run dev:turbo` for Turbopack (may fail with same error unless workspace root is `MeditateClaude`).
